# KSpigot Plugin Template
Because [emmaboecker/kspigot-gradle-template](https://github.com/emmaboecker/kspigot-gradle-template) was archived and isn't up to date we created our own template.

This project is inspired by [emmaboecker/kspigot-gradle-template](https://github.com/emmaboecker/kspigot-gradle-template)

## Version
You can switch between the branches to change the version

## Dependencies
| Dependency                   | Version | Repository    |
|------------------------------|---------|---------------|
| KSpigot (`net.axay:kspigot`) | 1.20.3  | Maven Central |

Version 1.20.3 is not an error, this is the version that KSpigot published for Minecraft version 1.20.4.

We are using [paperweight](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight) for the paper dependencies
